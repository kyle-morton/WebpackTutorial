# Webpack Tutorial 

tutorial course at https://webpack.academy

## 1) install webpack via NPM 'npm install webpack --save-dev'

## 2) run 'npm init' to setup node project

## 3) add 'build': 'webpack" property to scripts obj in the package.json file

## 4) create webpack.config.js file to configure webpack (webpack looks for this file by default)

## NOTE: to run webpack bundling script, run 'npm run-script build'. If configured correctly, webpack will output a file containing any input files as well as the webpack runtime that is runs it on the browser

## NOTE 2: after getting your output js file, you can run it in node using 'node OUTPUT_FILE.js'
